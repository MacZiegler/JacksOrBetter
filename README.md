# JacksOrBetter
Jacks or Better Video Poker Game

This project is intended to be an AngularJS version of the classic Jacks-or-Better video poker game as a web application.

My tendency is to immediately shoot for a product with all the bells and whistles and a beautiful interface right out of the gate. This time, I am focused on achieving basic functionality before adding even the first card image.

This game is fully responsive, and will be playable on the smallest smartphone and the largest monitor, smoothly translating for everything in between. For better or worse, I have no intention of supporting any legacy browsers.

Heck, I am even starting early on with a Readme file!

Anyway, the journey begins.
